I teach economic history to undergraduate and graduate students, and regularly publish on the subject academically, through journal articles and book chapters, as well as popularly, as a columnist, blogger, and podcast host.\nMy book, Our Long Walk to Economic Freedom (CUP), offers an accessible and engaging introduction to economic history from an African perspective. Its closing line – ‘The future belongs to those who believe in a better tomorrow’ – captures my conviction that economic history is fundamentally optimistic: we have the agency to build a more prosperous, equitable society.\nI see myself as a knowledge broker, who believes that effective science communication matters deeply. Stories not only help us understand the world around us, they actively shape it.\nMy blog, ourlongwalk.com, now followed by more than 5,000 subscribers, features my columns (News24, Currency, LitNet, Rapport) and essays. I also co-host the Our Long Walk podcast, available on all major platforms.\nMy greatest ambition is to be cited in a Nobel lecture – ideally by one of my students."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nI did not choose economic history; it chose me. It began, improbably, with a paper on ship traffic at the Cape and a Lisbon conference audience of three. There I met Jan Luiten van Zanden, the author of the quote above, and that conversation sent me to Utrecht University to do a PhD in Economic History. I completed it in 2012, using probate inventories and the Cape tax censuses to study the nature, causes, and distribution of wealth in the eighteenth-century Cape Colony.\nThat early work left me with a bias that still shapes everything I do: if you want to understand how societies change, you need evidence that is granular enough to surprise you. Quantitative records can do that. They can also puncture comfortable myths. In my case, the probate inventories and tax censuses made it hard to sustain the old story of a uniformly poor settler society.\nThe Cape of Good Hope Panel project is a direct descendant of that realisation. It is an ambitious effort to transcribe the full series of the opgaafrolle and to turn them into a household panel that can be followed over time, and, when matched to genealogies, across generations. The aim is not just a bigger spreadsheet. It is a new research infrastructure for South African history – one that can support questions we could not ask before, or could only ask impressionistically.\nWhat have we learned so far? Two things can be true at once. The Cape was, on average, a wealthy society by the standards of its time, and it was also a severely unequal one. My work using probate inventories and tax censuses shows that many settler farmers were well-off, even in comparison to some of the wealthiest societies of the period. But the same sources also reveal how sharply that prosperity was distributed, within and between groups. And once you can measure wealth at the household level, the questions become harder, and better: how did elites maintain their advantage; which factors made mobility possible; what did “opportunity” mean in a society built on unfree labour.\n\n\n\nThe closing conference of the Biography project in 2022\n\n\nThe richness of the Cape records also makes it possible to widen the lens beyond the usual protagonists. Some of my work has tried to recover histories of people who are often absent from conventional archives, precisely because their lives were not written down in the places historians tend to look. It is not archival cosplay. It is an attempt to make the evidentiary base of South African history more representative, and therefore more useful.\nBecause of this interest in Africa’s past, I was pulled early into the African Economic History Network, founded in 2011. That community has shaped my research in two ways. First, it has kept me honest about parochialism. South Africa is endlessly interesting, but it is not the whole story. Second, it pushed me to think about who gets to write economic history, and which skills and incentives determine who participates. In my own writing I have argued that the “data revolution” in African economic history is real, but unevenly distributed, and that building capacity on the continent is part of the scholarly job.\nMore recently, my attention has shifted from building datasets and answering historical questions to thinking harder about how economic history can matter for the present. With Chris Colvin, I define applied economic history as the systematic, context-sensitive use of historical reasoning to illuminate contemporary policy problems – not by offering ready-made lessons, but by disciplining the analogies and narratives that policymakers and publics already use. The move is subtle but important: instead of beginning with a historical episode and asking why it happened, an applied approach starts with a current problem and works backwards, testing which parallels illuminate and which mislead.\nThis is also where my role as Chair in Economics, History and Policy comes in. My research uses extensive historical records and quantitative analysis to investigate the drivers of societal change in South African history, with an eye on what that can contribute to economic theory and policy-making now. The past does not provide a blueprint. It does provide an inventory of alternatives, and a way to argue about trade-offs with more humility and more evidence than the usual policy advice allows."

    "text": "So what determined that I now teach, do research and write a weekly blog? I don’t know. It was never just one decision. I never decided to do this. It happened, but also not in a fatalistic, deterministic sense. It happened through the cumulative effects of millions of tiny, every-day decisions. Yes, some were bigger: my choice of university programme certainly influenced my future options, or my choice of where to apply for jobs, and whom to marry. But these bigger decisions, I would argue, were contingent on many smaller, earlier decisions. Take my PhD, for example. Had I not met Jan Luiten van Zanden at a Social Science History conference in Lisbon, where we happened to be at the same meeting for economists, and, if several months earlier, I had not come across a link to the conference website while browsing online, and a few months before that happened to find a dataset that intrigued me (a dataset I wasn’t searching for), Utrecht would have been nothing more than a pretty Dutch town. And so on, and so on. Life is a happenstance of uncoordinated decisions.\n(From a blog post I wrote in 2013, when I turned 31.)\nThe PhD studies of the first student to study under my supervision, Jeanne Cilliers, began with one such serendipitous moment: I opened a printed newspaper, a rare occurrence even then, only to notice an advertisement for a genealogical dataset. I followed it up, and gained access to what later became South African Families. Jeanne then did the unglamorous work: she cleaned, checked, and rebuilt the data, day after day, and turned it into evidence on how economic incentives shaped South Africa’s demographic transition.\nThose moments of serendipity are present for almost every student. By the time Abel Gwaindepi completed his PhD, he had already taken advantage of many such moments. In a post I wrote in 2018, I noted that he grew up in Zimbabwe, that his father worked on Anglo American’s sugarcane plantations, and that it was there, in a company school, that his talent was spotted. When he passed his final exams with flying colours, he received a scholarship to study in South Africa. Not knowing much about South Africa, he chose Fort Hare. Through various fortunate interactions, including applying for an ERSA workshop where we met, Abel ended up in Stellenbosch, and is now at the University of Copenhagen. What looks like luck from the outside is often just the habit of being willing to take the leap.\nAside from these happenstances of many uncoordinated decisions, the one characteristic these stories share is grit. Many see a PhD as a grand project, requiring a grand vision. Students arrive thinking they need a communist-style five-year plan. In my experience, though, grand visions or plans are not the binding constraints to success. The binding constraint is whether the student can keep moving through uncertainty or, put simply, to shake off whatever holds them back and just keep walking. Take Karl Bergemann. In the piece I wrote after his graduation, I describe meeting him shortly before Covid; three months into his PhD the world locked down. Later, he lost his father in a hit-and-run accident, and then, when funding ran out, he relied on Muaythai fights as an income stream while completing the dissertation. The point is that the most successful students are not uniquely brilliant, or creative or connected. They just get stuff done.\nSupervision teaches another lesson that is easy to forget in a profession that celebrates individual brilliance. Research is rarely a solitary achievement. It is made in company, through support, feedback, co-authorship. In the papers I published between 2019 and 2025, I’ve had more than 40 co-authors. Teamwork not only gets stuff done, but it makes life fun and interesting. Research can be lonely and disheartening, which is why collaboration matters.\nThat is why I’ve been particularly keen in recent years to recruit postdoctoral fellows. They bring momentum: they can take a promising dataset or half-built idea and turn it into a paper before the energy dissipates. They raise the ambition of the group while lowering the loneliness of the work. They also help build capacity in the only durable way I know: by working alongside students, sharing routines, and turning supervision from a one-to-one relationship into a small research community.\nSupervising students has been one of the great privileges of my academic life. But it also reminds me that we are all students, all the time. Many teachers and colleagues have been signposts on my own long walk. I want to acknowledge a few who have had a particularly important impact: Jan Luiten van Zanden, Price Fishback, Kris Inwood, James Robinson, Anne McCants, Stan du Plessis, and Tony Hopkins."
