    "text": "I am Professor of Economics and Chair of Economics, History and Policy at Stellenbosch University, where I also direct LEAP, the Laboratory for the Economics of Africa’s Past. I teach economic history to undergraduate and graduate students, and regularly publish on the subject academically, through journal articles and book chapters, as well as popularly, as a columnist, blogger, and podcast host.\nMy book, Our Long Walk to Economic Freedom (CUP), offers an accessible and engaging introduction to economic history from an African perspective. Its closing line – ‘The future belongs to those who believe in a better tomorrow’ – captures my conviction that economic history is fundamentally optimistic: we have the agency to build a more prosperous, equitable society.\nI see myself as a knowledge broker, who believes that effective science communication matters deeply. Stories not only help us understand the world around us, they actively shape it.\nMy blog, ourlongwalk.com, now followed by more than 5,000 subscribers, features my columns (News24, Currency, LitNet, Rapport) and essays. I also co-host the Our Long Walk podcast, available on all major platforms.\nMy greatest ambition is to be cited in a Nobel lecture – ideally by one of my students."
