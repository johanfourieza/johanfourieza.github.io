*So what determined that I now teach, do research and write a weekly blog? I don’t know. It was never just one decision. I never decided to do this. It happened, but also not in a fatalistic, deterministic sense. It happened through the cumulative effects of millions of tiny, every-day decisions. Yes, some were bigger: my choice of university programme certainly influenced my future options, or my choice of where to apply for jobs, and whom to marry. But these bigger decisions, I would argue, were contingent on many smaller, earlier decisions. Take my PhD, for example. Had I not met Jan Luiten van Zanden at a Social Science History conference in Lisbon, where we happened to be at the same meeting for economists, and, if several months earlier, I had not come across a link to the conference website while browsing online, and a few months before that happened to find a dataset that intrigued me (a dataset I wasn’t searching for), Utrecht would have been nothing more than a pretty Dutch town. And so on, and so on. Life is a happenstance of uncoordinated decisions.*\
*([From a blog post I wrote in 2013, when I turned 31.](https://www.ourlongwalk.com/p/turning-31))*

The PhD studies of the first student to study under my supervision, Jeanne Cilliers, began with one such serendipitous moment: I opened a printed newspaper, a rare occurrence even then, only to notice an advertisement for a genealogical dataset. I followed it up, and gained access to what later became South African Families. Jeanne then did the unglamorous work: she cleaned, checked, and rebuilt the data, day after day, and turned it into evidence on how economic incentives shaped South Africa’s demographic transition.

Those moments of serendipity are present for almost every student. By the time Abel Gwaindepi completed his PhD, he had already taken advantage of many such moments. In [a post I wrote in 2018](https://www.ourlongwalk.com/p/the-stories-we-do-not-tell), I noted that he grew up in Zimbabwe, that his father worked on Anglo American’s sugarcane plantations, and that it was there, in a company school, that his talent was spotted. When he passed his final exams with flying colours, he received a scholarship to study in South Africa. Not knowing much about South Africa, he chose Fort Hare. Through various fortunate interactions, including applying for an ERSA workshop where we met, Abel ended up in Stellenbosch, and is now at the University of Copenhagen. What looks like luck from the outside is often just the habit of being willing to take the leap.

Aside from these happenstances of many uncoordinated decisions, the one characteristic these stories share is grit. Many see a PhD as a grand project, requiring a grand vision. Students arrive thinking they need a communist-style five-year plan. In my experience, though, grand visions or plans are not the binding constraints to success. The binding constraint is whether the student can keep moving through uncertainty or, put simply, to shake off whatever holds them back and just keep walking. Take Karl Bergemann. In t[he piece I wrote after his graduation](https://www.ourlongwalk.com/p/on-runners-and-fighters), I describe meeting him shortly before Covid; three months into his PhD the world locked down. Later, he lost his father in a hit-and-run accident, and then, when funding ran out, he relied on Muaythai fights as an income stream while completing the dissertation. The point is that the most successful students are not uniquely brilliant, or creative or connected. They just get stuff done.

Supervision teaches another lesson that is easy to forget in a profession that celebrates individual brilliance. Research is rarely a solitary achievement. It is made in company, through support, feedback, co-authorship. In the papers I published between 2019 and 2025, I’ve had more than 40 co-authors. Teamwork not only gets stuff done, but it makes life fun and interesting. Research can be lonely and disheartening, which is why collaboration matters.

That is why I’ve been particularly keen in recent years to recruit postdoctoral fellows. They bring momentum: they can take a promising dataset or half-built idea and turn it into a paper before the energy dissipates. They raise the ambition of the group while lowering the loneliness of the work. They also help build capacity in the only durable way I know: by working alongside students, sharing routines, and turning supervision from a one-to-one relationship into a small research community.

Supervising students has been one of the great privileges of my academic life. But it also reminds me that we are all students, all the time. Many teachers and colleagues have been signposts on my own long walk. I want to acknowledge a few who have had a particularly important impact: Jan Luiten van Zanden, Price Fishback, Kris Inwood, James Robinson, Anne McCants, Stan du Plessis, and Tony Hopkins.
