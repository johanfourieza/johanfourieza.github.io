title: "'The future belongs to those who believe in a better tomorrow'"
---

I am Professor of Economics and Chair of Economics, History and Policy at Stellenbosch University, where I also direct LEAP, [the Laboratory for the Economics of Africa’s Past](https://leapstellenbosch.org.za/). I teach economic history to undergraduate and graduate students, and regularly publish on the subject academically, through journal articles and book chapters, as well as popularly, as a columnist, blogger, and podcast host.

My book, [*Our Long Walk to Economic Freedom*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/our-long-walk-to-economic-freedom/0985F9390A3B26B40DE0AC6BC1111414) (CUP), offers an accessible and engaging introduction to economic history from an African perspective. Its closing line – ‘The future belongs to those who believe in a better tomorrow’ – captures my conviction that economic history is fundamentally optimistic: we have the agency to build a more prosperous, equitable society.

I see myself as a knowledge broker – or, to use the language of economic history, an idea merchant – who believes that effective science communication matters deeply. Stories not only help us understand the world around us, they actively shape it.

My blog, [ourlongwalk.com](http://www.ourlongwalk.com), now followed by more than 4,000 subscribers, features my columns (News24, Currency, LitNet, Rapport) and essays. I also co-host the *Our Long Walk* podcast, available on all major platforms.

My greatest ambition is to be cited in a Nobel lecture – ideally one delivered by a student of mine.
